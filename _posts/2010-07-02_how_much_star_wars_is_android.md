#How much Star Wars is Android?

Last week, OpenIntents and the droidcon organization team received a cease and desist letter from Lucasfilm (Indian Jones, Star Wars, etc.) because we used "droidcon" for the Android conference in Germany. Lucasfilm claims "DROIDS" and variations as well as "iDroids" and "iDroidsMania" as trademarks in Europe.

We try to find a settlement out of court but the outcome is not clear. We only refer to Android and do not have anything to do with Star Wars. If Lucasfilm wants to stop all Android developers and companies to use the abbreviation droid we are in trouble. Please wish us luck!
