This year was the second year OpenIntents participated at the Google summer of code. We are an open source organization which creates software for Android mobile phones and tablets, with special emphasis on interoperability with other software components. This year was really big. We had 8 students and mentors this year. Unfortunately, one student dropped out after the first weeks. For the other projects we had nice results. There was one research and development project around Web Intents, two around shopping lists, one about performance and UI improvements and a joined project with three students about synchronization app data between different devices. The projects are described in more details below, the weekly reports are available at https://github.com/openintents/gsoc2012/wiki

Please read the full description of the projects at [our Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Abs9--QP4UxpGIKKubS4mGcQ8Wvy5Hr3M0BMAwbOGDc/edit).
