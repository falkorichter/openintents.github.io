Take an image and crop it according to the user's requirements. The output can be a URI or a (possibly) downsampled bitmap 
with the cropped image.

If the caller does not provide an image source as data then the activity should ask the user to pick an image using the Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT and mime-type image/*.

The caller may pass an extra EXTRA_OUTPUT to control where this image will be written.
If the EXTRA_OUTPUT is not present, then a small sized image is returned as a Bitmap
object in the extra field. This is useful for applications that only need a small image.
If the EXTRA_OUTPUT is present, then the full-sized image will be written to the Uri
value of EXTRA_OUTPUT.
